This repository consists of my ECC project from proposal to final report, assignments and the reference materials I have used in completing the project. 
I will keep updating the repo as the semester progresses.

I am currently working on building a Federated Learning Framework on jetstream2 using NVIDIA FLARE and Tensorflow Federated.
